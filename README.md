# document-voting-ui

This is a simple web interface for voting on (categorizing) documents from a
mongo database.  The end-use application I targeted was a porn filter for
user-generated content (snippets of text).  The labels were for “yes, this is
porn”; “no, this isn’t porn”; and “maybe this is porn”.  The code can be adapted
to change labels and/or the number of labels (such as two labels only (a binary
classification) or more labels).

This also represents a personal experiment for me too learn new technologies.
In particular:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)

Suggestions welcome.
